            <h2>What Possible Conditions Cause Wrist Pain?</h2>
            <p>
              Multiple joints make up the wrist. There are numerous small joints
              located in this area which are connected to the bones of the hand
              and forearm. As a result of a sudden injury,{" "}

              </Link>{" "}
              can result from sprains or fractures. Wrist injuries are sometimes
              caused by long-term conditions such as repetitive stress or
              arthritis as well as accidents.

              , making diagnosis difficult. Effective treatment and healing

                <h2>Possible Causes Of Pain In Wrist</h2>
                <p>Here are possible causes of wrist pain Corsicana.</p>
                <h4>Gout</h4>
                <p>
                  As opposed to osteoarthritis, gout is a metabolic disease
                  characterized by recurrent episodes of inflammation. A buildup
                  of uric acid causes inflammation of the joints. By breaking
                  down food, the body naturally produces uric acid. As a result
                  of this buildup, you may experience{" "}
                  <Link href="/contact-locations/hillsboro">
                    Wrist pain Hillsboro
                  </Link>
                  , soreness, and swelling. Diet, including excessive alcohol
                  consumption and fatty foods, is a common cause of flare-ups of
                  gout.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <h4>Injury</h4>A wrist injury may range from a fracture to a
                  sprain to a bruise. Tendonitis can also affect your wrists.
                  Bruising, swelling, and disfiguration of the wrist may
                  indicate an injury to the wrist caused by trauma or blunt
                  impact.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <h4>Tendinitis</h4>Tendons within the wrist move the wrist and
                  fingers. If the tendons are irritated, swelling may occur,
                  causing pain, or a rupture may occur spontaneously. Generally,
                  De Quervain's tenosynovitis affects your thumb side of your
                  wrist. De Quervain's tenosynovitis can cause severe pain in
                  the wrist and thumb.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <h4>Ganglion Cysts</h4>A fluid-filled lump appears in your
                  wrist. An enlarged cyst may constrict the nerves in the wrist,
                  resulting in a dull ache, tingling, and numbness. In spite of
                  this, no actual damage is caused to the nerves.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <h4>Neuropathy</h4>An individual with neuropathy has
                  experienced nerve damage or a disruption in the nerve pathways
                  that transmit messages between the body and the brain. Hands
                  and wrists may be tingly or painful as a result of neuropathy.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <h4> Carpal Tunnel Syndrome</h4>Inflammations of the hands and
                  wrists that result in pain, tingling, numbness, and weakness.
                  The median nerve is responsible for allowing your hand to move
                  and feel, so it is pressed upon in carpal tunnel syndrome.
                  Overweight or repetitive movements cause pressure.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <h4>Osteoarthritis</h4>As your cartilage (connective tissue
                  that covers your bones) wears down, this type of arthritis
                  develops. Osteoarthritis causes swelling, stiffness, and pain
                  as the bones rub against each other.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <h4>Psoriatic Arthritis</h4>A person with psoriasis will
                  develop thick, scaly patches of skin on their body along with
                  psoriatic arthritis. The symptoms of this type of arthritis
                  include swelling, pain, tenderness, and stiffness in your
                  wrist.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <h4>Systemic Lupus Erythematosus</h4>The body attacks healthy
                  tissue within the body as a result of an autoimmune disease.
