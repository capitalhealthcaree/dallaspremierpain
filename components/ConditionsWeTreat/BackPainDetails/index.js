              more likely to suffer from lower back pain.

            <p>
              The condition of back pain can occur at any time during a person's
              lifetime, and most of us will experience it at some time during
              our lives. Several factors can contribute to the development of

                  may cause a variety of symptoms. Here are a few of the most

                <li>

                  Other less common symptoms, however, are more severe. Among

                <li>Leg or foot pain, as well as back pain</li>

              symptoms can usually be diagnosed by a doctor following a physical
              examination and a discussion of symptoms. Imaging scans and other
              tests may be required if:
            </p>
            <li>Injury appears to cause back pain</li>
            <li>An underlying cause must be addressed</li>
            <li>Pain persists for a long time</li>
            <p>
              Soft tissues in the back can be assessed using X-rays, MRIs, or CT
              scans:
            </p>
            <li>
              X-rays can show bone alignment and arthritis, but not muscle
              damage, spinal cord damage, or nerve damage.
            </li>
            <li>
              Herniated discs, as well as other problems affecting tissues,
              tendons, nerves, ligaments, blood vessels, muscles, and bones, may
              be revealed by CT or MRI scans.
            </li>
            <li>
              In addition to detecting osteoporosis, bone scans can also detect
              cancers of the bones. This procedure involves injecting a
              radioactive substance into the body, known as a tracer. By using
              tracers collected in the bone, a doctor is able to detect bone
              problems with the help of a special camera. A bone scan is used by
              doctors for detecting fractures and diagnosing bone conditions.
            </li>
            <li>
              Nerve impulses are measured by electromyography as a result of
              muscle contractions. Herniated discs and spinal stenosis are two
              common causes of nerve compression.
