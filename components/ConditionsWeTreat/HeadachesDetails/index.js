              A scan or other imaging test may be helpful when ruling out other

              or tension headaches. Nevertheless, if your physician suspects you
              have another medical condition causing your headaches, he or she
              may order a variety of imaging tests to determine the cause. CT
              scans or MRIs can help determine if your headaches are related to
              a neurological condition. During both of these tests,
              cross-sectional images of your brain are produced that show
              abnormal or problematic areas.
