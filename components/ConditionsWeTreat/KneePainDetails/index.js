            <h2>What Causes Knee Pain?</h2>
            <p>
              A knee joint is composed of several components, including bone,
              cartilage, ligaments, and fluid. As a result of muscles and
              tendons, the knee joint moves. Any one of these structures can
              lead to knee problems. A variety of factors can contribute to knee
              pain, including:
            </p>
            <li>
              <b>Rheumatoid Arthritis.</b> Knees can be affected by swelling and
              cartilage damage.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Ligament Injuries.</b> During sudden twisting movements,
              anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries may result. A car
              accident can lead to injuries of the posterior cruciate ligament.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Cartilage Injuries and Disorders.</b> The kneecap cartilage can
              become soft due to overuse, injury, muscle weakness or
              misalignment of the knee. Furthermore, a blow to the knee may tear
              the cartilage off.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Broken Kneecap.</b> A fall or a direct blow to the knee often
              leads to a break in the small, round bone (patella) that sits over
              the front of the knee joint.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Tendon Injuries.</b> An overuse injury, such as sports or
              falls, can cause inflammation or tear.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Osteoarthritis.</b> A knee joint becomes more painful as
              cartilage wears away with the passage of time results in
              osteoarthritis.

        <h2>What Exactly is Knee Pain?</h2>
        <p>
          There are a number of potential causes of knee discomfort, the most
          prevalent of which are overuse, traumas, and arthritis. Knee
          discomfort is common in the elderly because of osteoarthritis, a
          degenerative joint disorder that can affect people of any age. Rest,
          anti-inflammatory medicine, and ice can reduce inflammation and pain
          if the underlying cause is treated. Damage may require treatment or
          surgery.
        </p>
        <p>
          This common knee problem mostly affects younger and older people
          alike, however, it is especially common among the former. Common
          symptoms of patellofemoral pain syndrome include kneecap discomfort or
          pain in the patellofemoral joint. Common activities that bring on pain
          include climbing stairs, stooping, squatting, cycling, and even
          sitting with bent knees. However, exercise therapy is often prescribed
          to persons who suffer from this condition.

              is also an essential factor in determining the best course of
              treatment. You will need a treatment plan depending on the
              severity of your injury. The majority of mild to moderate issues
              resolve themselves on their own. You can increase the healing
              process by taking the following steps:
            </p>
            <li>
              <b>Rest your Knee.</b> For a few days, do not engage in intense
              physical activity. Ice can relieve swelling and pain.In order to
              maintain a healthy weight, one should exercise every three to four
              hours for 15 to 20 minutes. Until the pain is gone, repeat the
              procedure for two or three days.

              <b>Ice.</b> can relieve swelling and pain. In order to maintain a
              healthy weight, one should exercise every three to four hours for
              15 to 20 minutes. Until the pain is gone, repeat the procedure for
              two or three days.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Compress your Knee.</b> Wrapping the joint in a bandage, strap,
              or sleeve is recommended. This will result in a reduction in
              swelling or the provision of additional support.
            </li>
            <li>
              When sitting or lying down, elevate your knee by placing a pillow
              under your heel. This will reduce swelling.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Take Anti-inflammatory Medications.</b> A number of NSAIDs are
              available to relieve pain and swelling, such as ibuprofen and
              naproxen. According to the instructions on the label, follow them.
              If your doctor does not instruct you otherwise, you should only
              use these medications occasionally since they may cause side
              effects.
            </li>
            <li>
              Follow your doctor's recommendations regarding stretching and
              strengthening exercises. In addition to physical therapy, you may
              wish to seek medical attention.
