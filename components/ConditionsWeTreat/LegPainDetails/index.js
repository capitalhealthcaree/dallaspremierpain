              may be caused by a variety of minor or temporary conditions that
              are easily treated by your physician. Minor injuries or overuse
              can hurt your legs, but this can also be an indication of a more
              serious health condition. A number of factors contribute to its
              development, including:
            </p>
            <li>
              <b>Systemic Conditions.</b> Diabetes mellitus and hypothyroidism
              are two conditions that may cause muscle and nerve damage in the
              legs. This results in numbness and pain.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Spinal Cord Compression.</b> An enlarged spinal canal in the
              neck may pressure the spinal cord, resulting in numbness and pain
              in both legs.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Spinal Nerve Compression or Irritation.</b> Inflammation,
              irritation, or compression of the lumbar or sacral spine can cause
              radiculopathy, more commonly known as sciatica. The damage to the
              nerves along their paths in the leg may also contribute to
              peripheral neuropathy and leg pain.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Blood Vessels Conditions.</b> Blockages of arteries or veins in
              the leg may cause numbness and pain in the leg.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Infection.</b> Infections of the bones and discs, such as
              osteomyelitis and spondylodiscitis, as well as viral infections,
              such as herpes zoster and HIV, are responsible for leg pain.

              caused by sacroiliac joint dysfunction or hip osteoarthritis,
              associated nerve irritation may result in numbness in the leg
              region. Symptoms of Piriformis syndrome include pain in the leg,
              numbness, and/or weakness.

            <li>
              <b>Cauda Equina Syndrome.</b> Compression of the Cauda Equina may

              resulting from spinal nerve compression.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Tumors and Cysts.</b> The presence of a mass or growth in the

              worsening symptoms should be reported to a physician. A physician
