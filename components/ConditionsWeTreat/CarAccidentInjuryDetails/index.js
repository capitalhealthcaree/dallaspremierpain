                  Know that Herniated discs occur when the impact of one vehicle
                  hitting another injures the spongy pads that separate the
                  vertebrae of each spine. Pain, weakness in the back, and
                  numbness are caused by the inability of the vertebral disc to
                  protect the nerve endings extending to the spinal column.

              <b>Cuts, bruises, and broken bones:</b> The most obvious injuries
              from car accidents are those you can clearly see on your skin.
              Cuts, scrapes, bruises, and broken bones are very common in car
              accidents. More serious injuries can occur when you are not
              properly restrained, and your body is thrown around the car during
              the collision.

              <b>Whiplash:</b> Whiplash is one of the most common injuries
              resulting from a car accident. When a car hits you from behind,
              the force of the collision sends your body forward. Caught by your
              seatbelt, the rest of your body stops, but your neck continues to
              travel forward until the top of the spine snaps your head back
              into place.

            Driving while impaired, distracted driving, and not wearing a

            help keep the roads safe for you and other drivers:

          <li>Wear a seatbelt.</li>
