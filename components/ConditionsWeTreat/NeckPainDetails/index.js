              over a workbench or leaning over a computer, may lead to neck

              . If you experience neck pain that radiates into a shoulder or
              down an arm, or numbness in your arms or hands, you should seek
              medical attention. The pain in the neck caused by acute injuries
              is usually not a cause for concern. The most common cause is tense
              muscles, like after working on a computer for a long time, being
              exposed to a cold draft, or sleeping wrong. Many cases, though,
              don't have a clear cause. The pain usually subsides in one to two
              weeks. However, certain situations, like those associated with
              work or intense physical activity, can bring it back.

              A chronic neck problem is one that lasts more than three months.
              Psychological stress often comes with chronic pain. The fear of

              exercising. However, as long as there are no signs of more serious
              problems, there is no cause for concern. Maintain your daily
              routine even if you experience pain. Performing exercises that

              may experience a variety of symptoms ranging in severity and
              duration. Typically, this condition lasts for a few days or weeks.
              As a result of the condition, it may become chronic. Depending on
              the severity of your neck pain, it may interfere with your daily
              activities of daily living, or it may be mild and not
              significantly impact your daily life. The following symptoms may
              be associated with neck pain:

            <li>
              <b>Stiff Neck.</b> A patient with neck pain may feel "stiff" or
              "stuck." Neck pain can cause a reduction in mobility.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Sharp Pain.</b> The pain in the neck may feel sharp or stabbing
              when it is localized.

              spine.

              <b>Radiating Pain or Numbness.</b> Symptoms of neck pain may
              spread to the head, trunk, shoulders, and arms. The compression of
              a nerve in the neck can cause numbness, tingling, or weakness in
              the hands or arms. Neck pain caused by pinched nerves may cause
              burning or sharp pains that travel down the arm. You should
              consult a physician if you experience this symptom.

            </h4>
            <p>
              A person's cervical spine can deteriorate, or degenerate, as they
              age due to natural wear and tear. Neck pain is often caused by
              degenerative conditions such as osteoarthritis (the loss of
              cartilage in joints) and spinal stenosis (a narrowing of spine
              spaces). A herniated disc or pinched nerve can occur over time as
              a result of stress and repeated movements in the spine.

            <p>
              During repetitive or strenuous activities, your neck muscles may
              be overused, resulting in stiffness and pain. An incorrectly
              aligned spine contributes to crick in neck, as can weak abdominal
              muscles, poor posture, and a heavy body weight. When you look at a

              You may experience neck pain and stiffness as a result of
              tightening your neck muscles as a result of stress. During times
              of stress or agitation, people tend to tighten their neck muscles
              without realizing they are doing so until they become painful.

            <p>
              A paramedic should immobilize a patient with severe neck pain
              following an injury (such as an accident in a motor vehicle, a
              diving accident, or a fall) to prevent further injury and possible
              paralysis. After a trauma, it is essential to seek medical care
              immediately; time is of the essence in preventing an injury.
            </p>
            <p>
              If your neck pain radiates down your arms and legs due to an
              injury, you should seek immediate medical attention. Regardless of
              whether you suffer from neck pain, you should seek medical
              attention if you experience numbness or radiating pain that causes
              weakness in your arms or legs. Changing handwriting skills,
              difficulty buttoning buttons, and dropping keys and cups may be
              subtle signs of spinal problems.
