            <h2>Causes and Treatment of Shoulder Pain</h2>
            <p>
              A shoulder's range of motion is wide and versatile. A
              dysfunctional shoulder can impede your ability to move freely and
              cause significant discomfort and pain. Anatomically, the shoulder
              is a ball-and-socket joint that contains three bones:the clavicle
              (collarbone), the humerus (long arm bone), and the scapula
              (shoulder blade).
            </p>
            <p>
              When you reach the age of 60, shoulder problems are more likely to
              occur. The degeneration of the soft tissues surrounding the
              shoulder contributes to a great deal of this. Manual labor,
              recreational activities, or repetitive movements can cause
              shoulder injuries. Certain diseases can also affect the shoulder.
              There are several of these conditions that affect the cervical
              spine (neck), the liver, the heart, and the gallbladder.

            <h2>Anatomy of shoulder</h2>
            <p>
              A cartilage cushion surrounds these bones. A body consists of two
              main joints. The acromioclavicular joint connects the scapula and
              the clavicle of the upper arm. The glenohumeral joint is a
              ball-shaped joint on the anterior side of the humerus bone,
              composed of the top portion of the humerus bone and the outer edge
              of the scapula. Joints such as this are also called shoulder
              joints.
            </p>
            <p>
              Among the joints of the body, the shoulder is the most mobile.
              During this motion, the shoulder moves forward and backward. As
              well as allowing the arm to rotate in a circular motion, it also
              permits it to move upwards and away from the body. Rotator cuffs
              provide range of motion to the shoulders.
            </p>
            <p>
              There are four tendons that make up the rotator cuff. Tendons are
              the connective tissue between muscles and bones. Damaged or
              swollen tendons and bones around the rotator cuff may make lifting
              your arm over your head painful or difficult.

            <p>
              The cartilage covers the ends of bones where they meet in joints,
              providing a smooth, cushiony surface. Smooth joint movement is
              made possible by healthy cartilage. Osteoarthritis results from
              the wear and tear on cartilage over time, or from damage caused by
              injury or accident.

              A synovitis is an inflammation of the shoulder synovial membrane.
              Aside from rheumatoid arthritis, synovitis can also result from
              injury or another disease. An adhesive capsulitis, also known as
              frozen shoulder, is an inflammation and tightening of the shoulder
              capsule. A decrease in synovial fluid may also result in a
              decrease in joint lubrication. Thus, it is difficult to move the
              shoulder as a result.

            <p>
              A frozen shoulder can result from another medical condition or

              small sac filled with fluid found in bone, muscle, and tendons
              that serves to reduce friction between them. Performing repetitive
              movements can lead to inflammation of the bursa located between
              the rotator cuff tendon and the nice tip of the shoulder
              (acromion).
