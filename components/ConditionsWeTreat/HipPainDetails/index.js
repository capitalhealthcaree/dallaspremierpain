              Overuse of the hips is a common cause of injury in dancers,

              You may feel better by resting, taking anti-inflammatory
              medication, and applying ice, depending on the cause. For more
              severe injuries, it may be necessary to undergo surgical repair.
              An arthroscopic procedure is available for the treatment of
              acetabular labrum tears and torn acetabular tendons. The severity
              of the damage may determine whether your doctor recommends hip
              replacement surgery.

                  arthritis, especially among older adults. As a result of
                  arthritis, the hip joint becomes inflamed and cartilage is
                  damaged. Gradually, the pain becomes more severe. Arthritis

              What Are The Treatment Options For Hip Pain?
            </h2>
            <p>
              Treatment of hip injuries depends on what the cause of the injury
              is, as well as the severity of the injury. A period of rest heals
              a hip injured during exercise. Pain of this nature usually
              subsides within a few days.
            </p>
            <li>
              Medications will be prescribed to you if you suffer from
              arthritis.
            </li>
            <li>
              A physician may also refer you to a specialist who can provide
              additional advice as well as to a physical therapist who can
              provide you with exercises to maintain joint flexibility.
            </li>
            <li>
              It is usually necessary to treat injuries by resting and taking
              medications, such as naproxen (Aleve), to reduce swelling and
              pain.
            </li>
            <li>
              For fractures, malformations, and certain injuries to the hip, the
              hip may require repair or replacement. Hip replacement surgery
              involves the replacement of the damaged hip joint with an
              artificial joint.
            </li>
            <li>
              However, most hip replacement surgeries require some physical
              therapy to adapt to the new joint, but they are generally
              successful.
