            <h2>Is Sciatica Pain Disturbing Your Quality Of Life</h2>
            <p>
              In the human body, the sciatic nerve is the longest and the widest
              nerve. At least 40 percent of people will experience sciatica
              Richardson at some point in their lifetime, according to experts.
              Throughout the lower back, the sciatic nerve runs along the
              buttocks and down the legs, ending below the knee. Sciatica pain
              may result from an inflamed, compressed, or pinched nerve in the{" "}
              <Link href="/conditions-we-treat/back-pain">lower back</Link> or
              legs. In sciatica, the sciatic nerve is irritated, resulting in
              pain.

              is primarily caused by an inflamed nerve in the lower spinal
              column. As a result of this disease, symptoms may also occur in
              the legs and back. Generally, people suffering from sciatica will
              have a successful recovery over time if they take care of
              themselves. A severe case of sciatica may require surgery, but
              sciatica is not a serious health risk in general.

            <h2>What Are sciatica Symptoms? </h2>
            <p>Sciatica pain symptoms include:</p>
            <li>
              Pain. One or more nerves are compressed in sciatica, resulting in
              pain.{" "}
            </li>
            <li>
              An electric shock or burning sensation are described as the pain
              associated with sciatica
            </li>
            <li>
              You may also experience symptoms of pain down the leg of the
              affected side.
            </li>
            <li>
              If you lie on your back, cough, sneeze, or bend or lift your legs
              upward, you may experience back pain.
            </li>
            <li>
              Tingling or “pins and needles” (paresthesia). A similar sensation
              can be experienced while sitting cross-legged when a leg falls
              asleep.
            </li>
            <li>
              Numbness. When you suffer from this condition, there will be no
              sensations on your skin or in the affected areas of your back or
              leg. Therefore, your brain is not able to receive signals from
              your back or leg.
            </li>
            <li>
              Muscle weakness. This type of illness presents with more severe
              symptoms. The problem arises when muscle command signals are
              unable to reach their intended destinations in the back or legs.
            </li>
            <li>
              Urinary incontinence or fecal incontinence. The severity of this
              symptom is extremely high. As a result, your bladder and bowels do
              not receive the signals they require to function properly.
            </li>
            <h2>Risk Factors</h2>
            <p>Sciatica is associated with the following risk factors:</p>
            <li>
              In diabetics, nerve damage is more likely to occur due to
              disruptions in the blood sugar metabolism.
            </li>
            <li>
              A herniated disc and bone spur are two of the most common causes
              of sciatica Waxahachie
            </li>
            <li>
              The development of sciatica can occur when a person twists their
              backs, lifts heavy objects, or drives for a long period of time.
            </li>
            <li>
              The presence of obesity increases spinal stress leading to
              sciatica
            </li>
            <li>
              Individuals who participate in physical activity are less likely
              to experience sciatica from prolonged sitting than those who sit
              for long periods of time or do not move frequently.
            </li>
            <h2>Sciatica Diagnosis</h2>
            <p>
              You will be asked several questions during your doctor's
              examination. Moreover, you will undergo a physical examination to
              determine your muscle strength and to determine your reflexes. To
              determine the cause of your discomfort, you may be asked to
              perform certain activities, such as walking on your heels or toes.
              In the event that your pain is severe, your doctor may order
              imaging tests to determine whether bone spurs or herniated disks
              are present. You may be able to participate in the following
              tests:{" "}
            </p>
            <li>
              <b>X-ray,</b>which involves taking photographs of the inside of
              your body in order to detect bone spurs (growths of normal bone).
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>MRI,</b>a treatment that uses radio waves to create images of
              the inside of the body in order to obtain a detailed view of the
              spine and back..

              </Link>
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Electromyography (EMG),</b> Using this device, you can measure
              the speed at which nerve signals travel through your muscles. If
              these tests are inconclusive, you may require further imaging.
            </li>
            <h2>When to See a Doctor</h2>
            <p>
              The symptoms of sciatica usually resolve over time. If you are not
              able to relieve your symptoms by self-care, consult your primary
              care physician. You should consult your physician if the pain
              persists, becomes more severe, or lasts longer than a week. The
              following symptoms should be reported to your physician
              immediately:

            <h2>Tips to Get Rid of Sciatica Pain</h2>
            <p>
              Treatment of the underlying cause of sciatica is essential because
              sciatica is a symptom of a more specific medical condition.
