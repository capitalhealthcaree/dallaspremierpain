            <h2>Arthritis Pain: Symptoms, Causes, Types & Treatment</h2>
            <p>
              A variety of diseases can lead to arthritis, which is
              characterized by inflammation and damage to joints, adjacent
              tissues, and other connective tissues. The United States is home
              to 58.5 million adults who are suffering from arthritis, which
              affects one in four Americans. People over the age of 65 are more
              likely to suffer from this disease. There is also a possibility
              that this disease will affect children. Three of the most common
              types of arthritis are psoriatic arthritis, osteoarthritis, and
              rheumatoid arthritis.

            <p>
              Arthritis can cause inflammation and pain in the knees. Generally,

              Loose cartilage fragments and other tissue can impair joint
              motion. Knees may lock or stick when moved. Cramps, clicks, snaps,
              or grinding sounds may be heard (crepitus). Pain may cause knee
              buckling or weakness. As a result of changing weather conditions,

            <h2>What Causes Arthritis?</h2>
            <p>
              Several types of arthritis have unknown causes. An investigation
              is being conducted into the role that genetics (hereditary) and
              lifestyle play in the development of arthritis. Several factors
              may increase your risk of arthritis, including:
            </p>
            <li>
              <b>Age:</b> It is inevitable that joints will wear and tear with
              time. Therefore, osteoarthritis, in particular, is a disease
              associated with aging.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Sex:</b> A woman is generally more likely than a man to suffer
              from arthritis, with the exception of gout.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Genes:</b> The development of arthritis in Hillsboro is
              strongly influenced by family history. Ankylosing spondylitis,
              lupus, and rheumatoid arthritis are associated with certain genes.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Excessive Weight:</b> Overweight increases the wear and tear on
              weight-bearing joints, as well as the risk of arthritis, including
              osteoarthritis.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Injuries:</b> As a result, some types of conditions may occur
              as a result of joint damage. Infection. Inflammation of the joints
              can be caused by bacteria, viruses, or fungi.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Work:</b> Occupational tasks that require repetitive movements
              or heavy lifting may stress the joints or cause an injury, which
              may lead to arthritis, particularly osteoarthritis. Working at a
              job that requires frequent bending and squatting of your knees can
              increase your risk of osteoarthritis.
            </li>
            <h2>Diagnosis of Arthritis Pain</h2>
            <p>
              The cause of your symptoms will be determined by your doctor
              during an examination. A physician will examine the patient in
              order to determine whether the patient has arthritis Decatur or an
              autoimmune disorder.
            </p>
            <li>
              Blood tests are useful in detecting inflammation and arthritis. A
              joint examination may require the collection of fluid samples.
            </li>
            <li>
              An x-ray, ultrasound, or CT scan may be performed in order to
              identify cartilage loss or narrowing of the joint space.{" "}
              <li>
                A definitive diagnosis of some types of arthritis may require
                several visits and tests. An alternative is to visit a
                rheumatologist who specializes in joint disorders, as
                recommended by your physician.

            <h2>How is Arthritis Treated?</h2>
            <p>
              In spite of the fact that arthritis cannot be cured, there are
              several treatments available that can help manage the disease. An
              individual's treatment plan for arthritis will depend on the
              severity of the condition, its symptoms, and his or her overall
              health. The following are conservative (nonsurgical){" "}

            </p>
            <h3>Medication</h3>
            <p>
              Medication that reduces inflammation and pain may relieve
              arthritis symptoms. The immune system's response to inflammation
              is targeted by some medications, called biologics. Rheumatoid
              arthritis and psoriatic arthritis can be treated with biologics by
              healthcare professionals.

            <h3>Physiotherapy</h3>
            <p>
              In addition to improving a patient's strength, range of motion,
              and mobility, rehabilitation can also improve his or her quality
              of life. Depending on your daily activities, you may be able to

              with the assistance of a physical therapist.

            <h3>Therapeutic Injections</h3>
            <p>
              Joint pain and inflammation may be temporarily relieved by
              cortisone injections. Certain joints can benefit from
              viscosupplementation, such as the knee. Joints are lubricated with
              lubricants in order to prevent friction.
            </p>
            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>
              Most people are required to manage arthritis for the remainder of
              their lives as arthritis is an incurable disease. If you wish to
              reduce the severity of your symptoms, you should select the
              appropriate combination of treatments. Arthritis can adversely
              affect a person's health if he or she is inactive. The pain
              associated with joints can exacerbate serious health conditions
              such as cancer, heart disease, diabetes, and others.
