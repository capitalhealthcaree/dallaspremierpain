            <h2>Lumbar Sympathetic Injections</h2>
            <p>
              The lumbar sympathetic injections may be used to treat vascular
              insufficiency, complex regional pain syndrome, reflex sympathetic
              dystrophy, or shingles. Along the front of the spine, there are
              clusters of nerve cells known as sympathetic nerves. Medications
              are administered to the sympathetic nerves located along the
              spinal column. Lumbar sympathetic nerve blocks provide temporary
              relief from pain in the lower extremities by injecting numbing
              medication into the lower back. An anti-inflammatory medication
              may be combined with a local anesthetic to promote nerve healing.
              Upon the reduction of pain, physical therapy can be resumed as
              well as normal activities.

          <h2>Procedure For Lumbar Sympathetic Injections</h2>
          <p>
            Your healthcare provider should provide you with information
            regarding what to expect. The procedure may need to be modified. In
            general,{" "}
            <Link href="/contact-locations/lancaster">
              lumbar sympathetic injections lancaster
            </Link>{" "}
            consist of the following steps:
          </p>
          <li>
            A table will be used to perform the procedure while you lie on your
            stomach.
          </li>
          <li>
            Sedative medications may be administered in some cases in order to
            assist you in relaxing. The procedure is likely to take place while
            you are awake.
          </li>
          <li>
            It is necessary to monitor your blood pressure, heart rate, and
            oxygen level throughout the procedure.
          </li>
          <li>
            A cleaning of the{" "}
            <Link href="/conditions-we-treat/back-pain">lower back</Link> area
            will also be performed prior to the injection.
          </li>
          <li>
            The area surrounding the injection will be numbed with a numbing
            agent. Short-term stinging and burning may occur. Although the
            effect should last only for a short time, it should only be
            temporary.
          </li>
          <li>
            Your healthcare provider will insert a needle into the lower back
            area. As soon as he or she receives it, one of his or her employees
            will transfer it to the appropriate location. Physicians may guide
            the needle with the help of X-rays, CT scans, or ultrasounds.
          </li>
          <li>
            To ensure that the contrast dye is injected at the correct location,
            the provider will inject a small amount through the needle.
          </li>
          <li>
            Afterward, a needle will be used to inject the medicine. Different
            types of medicine may be used by him or her for different reasons. A
            numbing medication may be necessary to block the pain.
          </li>
          <li>
            If inflammation occur, then it can be reduced with the help of
            steroids.
          </li>
          <li>
            Immediately after the injection, you may experience a warm or
            burning sensation.
          </li>
        </div>
        <h2>Expected Results</h2>
        <p>
          Injections of the lumbar sympathetic system can relieve the affected
          extremity within minutes of the procedure. For prolonged relief,
          additional injections are usually required.
        </p>
        <p>
          After the procedure, it is recommended that you refrain from driving
          for several hours due to the possibility of temporary weakness or
          numbness in the lower extremities. On the day of the procedure, you
          should take it easy, but return to your usual activities the following
          day. You may experience some soreness for one to two days following
          the procedure, but you will normally experience the benefits within a
          few days.
