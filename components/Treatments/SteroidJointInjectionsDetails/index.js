            <h2>Steroid Joint Injections</h2>
            <p>
              Taking steroids orally or injecting them directly into the
              affected area can treat arthritis and related conditions.
              Injections reduce inflammation, which reduces pain. You may also
              receive one if you have extremely painful joints or need
              additional pain relief. Mostly steroid injections treat symptoms,
              but not the underlying cause.

            <h2>Preparation for a Steroid Joint Injection</h2>
            <li>
              During your consultation with your doctor, you will be informed of
              what to expect after receiving a steroid joint injection. If you
              have questions, please ask. To ensure your consent, you should
              feel fully informed before receiving an injection.
            </li>
            <li>
              The health professional performing your injection should be
              informed if you experience any symptoms.
            </li>
            <li>
              Your blood thins as a result of the medication you take. Blood
              clotting can be inhibited by the use of anticoagulants, like
              Warfarin. This increases your risk of experiencing joint bleeding.
              For the purpose of determining the health of your blood clots, it
              may be necessary to conduct an examination of them.
            </li>
            <li>
              Having a disease affecting blood clotting, such as hemophilia, is
              one of the conditions that affect blood clotting. You may also
              experience bleeding in your joints due to this.
            </li>
            <li>
              Diabetes is a condition that you have. Steroid joint injections
              may raise your blood sugar levels for several days following the
              injection.
            </li>
            <li>
              If you are using steroids or local anaesthetics, you may develop
              allergies.
            </li>
            <li>The skin may be infected or the joints may be inflamed.</li>
            <li>
              Also, you might be pregnant or nursing if you are reading this. An
              injection of steroid steroid joint injections does not pose any
              risk to women who are pregnant or breast-feeding. The decision
              should still be discussed with a health care provider before it is
              made, though.
            </li>
            <li>
              Preparation for steroid joint injections is usually not necessary.
            </li>
            <li>
              It can be hard for you to drive after receiving an injection. If
              you need assistance getting home, your friends or family may be
              able to assist you. In the days following the procedure, the joint
              should rest.
            </li>
            <li>
              In order to facilitate injections, you should wear comfortable
              clothing that allows you to gain access to the joint easily.
            </li>
            <h2>Procedure</h2>
            <li>
              The procedure requires the signing of consent forms and the
              listing of all of your current medications. You should tell your
              doctor if you have ever experienced an allergic reaction.
            </li>
            <li>
              Depending on the complexity of the procedure, you may require a
              period of recovery of 15 to 45 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
              As part of an X-ray examination, the patient lies on an X-ray
              table. To reduce discomfort, a local anesthetic is injected into
              the treated area prior to{" "}
              <Link href="/treatments">treatments</Link>.
            </li>
            <li>
              The patient can provide feedback to the physician while the
              procedure is being performed, provided that the patient is awake
              and aware.
            </li>
            <li>
              In order to perform the procedure, sedatives such as Valium or
              Versed are required. A fluoroscope (special X-ray device) is used
              to insert a hollow needle into the painful area during this
              procedure.
            </li>
            <li>
              The fluoroscope monitor allows the doctor to monitor the needle in
              real-time to ensure it is positioned at the desired location. The
              needle's location may be verified by contrast injection.
            </li>
            <li>
              During the procedure, patients typically feel pressure rather than
              pain.
            </li>
            <li>
              The joint capsule is injected with anesthetics and corticosteroids
              once the needle is properly positioned.
            </li>
            <li>
              It's time to remove the needle. It depends on where the pain is,
              but you can get injections in one or more joints.
            </li>
            <h2>Expected Results</h2>
            <p>
              In cases where the joint that was treated was the source of the
              pain, the pain may diminish within two to seven days of receiving
              the injection.This period of time will consist of several days to
              several months of physical therapy. If pain recurs after
              injections, repeat injections can be administered. Pain relief may
              be available with other treatment options.
