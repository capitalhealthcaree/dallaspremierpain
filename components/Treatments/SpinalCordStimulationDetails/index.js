            <h2>Spinal Cord Stimulation</h2>
            <p>
              Chronic pain occurs when the body's normal response to an injury
              lasts for an extended period of time than expected. As a result,
              this pain is no longer beneficial to the body, instead it harms it
              on its own. Work, eating, exercising, and other daily activities
              can be substantially impacted by pain. Chronic pain can lead to
              other long-term health conditions such as depression, weight gain,
              and issues related to the overuse of medications.
            </p>
            <p>
              The body transmits nerve signals to the brain continuously. By
              alerting an individual to a problem, injury is
              prevented.Unfortunately, nerve damage can cause the brain to
              receive pain signals even without physical injury. With spinal
              cord stimulation, these signals can be disrupted so that they are
              not received by the brain.

            <h2>Procedure</h2>
            <li>One to two hours are generally required for surgery.</li>
            <li>
              A light anesthetic will be administered during the procedure,
              which will involve lying on your stomach on a table. In the next
              step, the leads and generator will be placed in the area between
              your back and buttocks.
            </li>
            <li>
              Fluoroscopy (an X-ray type of procedure) is used to insert the
              electrode leads. A small incision is made in the middle of the
              back to expose the bony vertebrae.
            </li>
            <li>
              A portion of the bony arch must be removed to accommodate leads
              (laminotomy). The epidural space is then sutured to a series of
              leads above the spinal cord. Your spinal cord is not directly
              touched by the leads.
            </li>
            <li>
              You may be awakened depending on the type of SCS device being
              implanted to ensure it covers your pain areas effectively.
            </li>
            <li>
              Modern SCS devices, however, can position leads according to
              anatomical features or electrically monitored nerves.
            </li>
            <li>
              At the conclusion of surgery, the pulse generator will be
              programmed using the trial settings.
            </li>
            <li>Pain relief effectiveness depends on your feedback.</li>
            <li>
              Occasionally, if the leads implanted during the trial are
              correctly positioned, there is no need to reposition them or
              insert new ones.
            </li>
            <li>
              Once the lead electrodes have been inserted, the generator is
              implanted under the skin under the skin of the buttock.
            </li>
            <li>
              An incision is made below the waistline during the procedure. In
              order to place the generator in the pocket, the surgeon creates
              one under the skin. A lead wire connects a pulse generator. Place
              the generator in the skin pocket so that it is positioned
              correctly.
            </li>

          <h2>Advantages of this Procedure</h2>
          <p>
            A number of advantages can be derived from spinal cord stimulation.
          </p>
          <li>
            Aside from treating pain that has not responded to other treatments,
            it can also be used to treat chronic pain. Using spinal cord
            stimulation as a treatment alternative may be a viable option in
            cases where other treatments have failed.
          </li>
          <li>
            Several types of pain are treated with the drug. During spinal cord
            stimulation, chest pain, nerve pain, and back pain related to the
            heart are treated.
          </li>
          <li>
            Therefore, people may be able to use fewer stronger pain
            medications. Opioid-based painkillers are often required to treat
            chronic pain. The use of these medications is associated with
            potential risks and side effects. In some cases, spinal cord
            stimulation may be able to reduce the intensity of pain in the body.
            In this way, you will be able to reduce the dosage or frequency with
            which you take your pain medication.
          </li>
          <li>You may try it temporarily prior to undergoing major surgery.</li>
        </div>
        <p>
          Trials are the most common method of spinal cord stimulation. It is
          generally possible to reverse a failed trial without surgery if it is
          unsuccessful.
        </p>
