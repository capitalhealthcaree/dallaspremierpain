            <h2>What You Need To Know About Lumbar Percutaneous Discectomy?</h2>
            <p>
              Sciatica is typically treated with open surgery (eg, with a large
              incision) that decompresses the disc and relieves pressure on
              nearby nerve roots. Herniated or slipped discs usually cause
              sciatica or{" "}
              <Link href="/conditions-we-treat/leg-pain">leg pain</Link> that
              requires decompression surgery. The surgical techniques for disc
              decompression surgery have advanced, and now endoscopic and small
              incisions are used to access the disc using a microscope or
              similar technology.
            </p>
            <p>
              An approach referred to as percutaneous decompression uses a
              needle for the entire decompression procedure. A percutaneous disc
              decompression or percutaneous discectomy may benefit patients with
              contained herniated discs.

            <h2>Benefits of a Lumbar Percutaneous Discectomy</h2>
            <p>
              It is advantageous to perform lumbar percutaneous discectomy. In
              most cases, the procedure is relatively straightforward and
              provides rapid relief from pain. Because it is minimally invasive,
              little scarring or pain is associated with the procedure. In
              comparison with other procedures, lumbar percutaneous discectomy
              offers the following advantages:
            </p>
            <li>Assists in the biopsy of tissue</li>
            <li>Nerve roots are not damaged by thermal (heat) action</li>
            <li>Ensures that the amount of material aspirated is controlled</li>
            <li>Each procedure can be customized</li>

              carries fewer risks than other types of spinal surgery, as well as
              allowing for quicker recovery times.
            </p>
            <h2>What Are The Risks Associated With This Procedure?</h2>
            <p>
              This procedure is associated with low risks. The following are
              among them:
            </p>
            <li>Dye or medication allergies</li>
            <li>Damage to the nerves (spinal cord and nerve roots)</li>
            <li>The injection site may experience bleeding and bruising</li>
            <li>The presence of infection</li>
            <li>
              The term discitis refers to an infection of the disc in the spine
            </li>
            <li>The pain does not improve or worsen (in some cases).</li>
            <h2>How Is A Percutaneous Discectomy(PD) Performed?</h2>
            <p>
              A sedative and local anesthetic are administered to the patient
              prior to the procedure to alleviate pain and stress. Once the
              patient is positioned face down, the surgeon can easily access the
              affected area. After numbing the surgical site, the surgeon
              inserts the larger needle into the target area through the skin
              using a fluoroscopic instrument.
            </p>
            <p>
              After placing the needle in the disc, the surgeon makes use of
              heat waves to reduce the disc's size and remove any disruptive
              material. Removing disc material from a herniated disc usually
              results in a reduction of pressure within the vertebral column as
              well as pain relief. Following the closure of the needle insertion
              site, the patient is transferred to a recovery area for
              observation.
            </p>
            <p>
              PDs are typically performed outpatient and take approximately 30
              minutes. Within one to three hours of surgery, patients are
              generally able to return home. The injection site may feel
              sensitive for the first 24 to 48 hours following the injection.
              Depending on the severity of the discomfort, the patient may apply
              hot or cold packs as needed and if necessary, may be prescribed
              pain medication to take as instructed following the procedure.
              Additionally, it is recommended that the patient rest for the next
              24 hours in order to facilitate a smooth recovery. Despite the
              fact that recovery times vary from case to case, most patients are
              able to return to their normal activities within a week.

            <p>
              In the US, back pain is a highly common ailment that impacts
              millions of adults.{" "}
              <Link href="/conditions-we-treat/back-pain">Back pain</Link> could
              be eased using conservative treatment alternatives such as heat,
              ice, heat, analgesic medication, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory
              drugs (NSAIDs), and physiotherapy. The use of opioids and surgical
              intervention is more commonly prescribed for patients with chronic
              and severe back pain.
            </p>
            <p>
              Back pain caused by herniated discs rarely responds to
              conservative treatments. As noninvasive therapies have become
              increasingly available over the past ten years, a wide variety of
              options have been developed to provide these individuals with an
              alternative to invasive procedures.{" "}

              procedure is offered to patients with disc herniations who have
              not responded to conventional treatment methods.It involves
              reducing or removing the tissue that is believed to be causing the
              herniated disc to become inflamed and to cause back pain. Once the
              materials have been removed, patients usually experience pain
              relief and a reduction in pressure on the adjacent spinal nerves.

              has been shown to reduce pain and medication requirements in up to
              90 percent of patients, while increasing their functional
              capacity. During the procedure, no muscles or bones are cut, so
              there is a fast recovery and minimal scarring. Within a few hours
              of the procedure, most patients are able to return home and resume
              their daily routine. Additionally, studies have shown that{" "}
